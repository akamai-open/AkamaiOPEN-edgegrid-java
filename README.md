# edgegrid-auth-java

Java library for EdgeGrid Client Authentication

## Summary

edgegrid-auth-java is a Java library for signing requests to APIs that are carried on the Akamai EdgeGrid network. It builds on the [Google HTTP Client Library for Java](https://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/) and adds the EdgeGrid signature to a normal [HttpRequest](http://javadoc.google-http-java-client.googlecode.com/hg/1.17.0-rc/com/google/api/client/http/HttpRequest.html).


## Usage

Use the library is pretty simple.

First, create a `RequestSigner` object. `EdgeGridV1Signer` is one (the only currently provided) implementation of the `RequestSigner` interface.

The constructor of `EdgeGridV1Signer` takes two parameters:

* `headers`: for specifying the ordered list of request headers to be included in the request signature. This is provided by the API service provider.
* `maxBodySize`: for specifying the maximum allowed size in bytes of the request body, for POST and PUT requests. This value is also provided by the API service provider.

This `RequestSigner` object can then be used to sign the requests.

To sign an [HttpRequest](http://javadoc.google-http-java-client.googlecode.com/hg/1.17.0-rc/com/google/api/client/http/HttpRequest.html):

1. first, add the Host header with the hostname of the request;

2. then, sign the request with a `ClientCredential` that encapsulates the following:

 * `clientToken`: for specifying the client token obtained from the client provisioning process
 * `accessToken`: for specifying the access token obtained from the client authorization process
 * `clientSecret`: for specifying the client secret that is associated with the client token


## Example

Here is an example code snippet:

```java         
RequestSigner signer = new EdgeGridV1Signer(Collections.EMPTY_LIST, 1024 * 2);
URI uri = new URI("https", "akaa-u5x3btzf44hplb4q-6jrzwnvo7llch3po.luna.akamaiapis.net",			 
	"/billing-usage/v1/reportSources", null, null);
HttpTransport HTTP_TRANSPORT = new ApacheHttpTransport();
HttpRequestFactory requestFactory = HTTP_TRANSPORT.createRequestFactory();
HttpRequest request = requestFactory.buildGetRequest(new GenericUrl(uri));
HttpHeaders headers = request.getHeaders();
headers.set("Host", "akaa-u5x3btzf44hplb4q-6jrzwnvo7llch3po.luna.akamaiapis.net");
ClientCredential credential = new DefaultCredential("akaa-nev5k66unzize2gx-5uz4svbszp4ko5wq"
	"akaa-ublu6mqdcqkjw5lz-542a56pcogddddow", "SOMESECRET");
HttpRequest signedRequest = signer.sign(request, credential);
```
